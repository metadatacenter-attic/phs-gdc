# Introducing the PHS-Data Commons Wizard Prototype

This prototype blends the talents of the Google Data Commons team, the Stanford Center for Population Health Sciences (PHS) team, 
and the Stanford Center for Biomedical Informatics Research (BMIR) team to create a low-friction tool
to discover and use freely available research data.

## Opportunity

### The data

The Google-provided [Data Commons repository](https://datacommons.org/) provides access to numerous public data sets 
that can be applied to research in many domains. The Data Commons Graph aggregates data from many different data sources
into a single database, so that it can be accessed in a consistent way.
This data is browseable by [place](https://datacommons.org/place/) or [entity](https://datacommons.org/browser/), 
and publicly accessible via APIs, with numerous [python libraries](http://docs.datacommons.org/api/) 
and Python workbook examples](http://docs.datacommons.org/tutorials). 

### The researchers

Researchers in the Stanford PHS team, like all biomedical data researchers, must find, obtain, and integrate useful data quickly.
At PHS, the goal is to improve the health of populations by bringing together diverse disciplines and data 
to understand and address social, environmental, behavioral, and biological factors on both a domestic and global scale.
PHS offers access to unique data, collaboration opportunities, education and training, and events to achieve this goal.
They also offer a data management approach that openly seeks more advanced ways to access and integrate related data sets,
and are providing research-centric leadership of the PHS-Data Commons project.

### The developers

The BMIR team brings it experience with research data and metadata, semantic technologies, 
and highly usable and scalable research software to make the Data Commons resources readily accessible 
to PHS researchers and the larger research community.
Through analysis of the data models and availability in the Data Commons, 
the BMIR team is identifying and implementing highly efficient interactions for researchers
to find any relevant data and bring it into their own data sets.
